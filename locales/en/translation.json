The beacon gives a signal — there is a place in the world where they will help to cope with the pain, where they appreciate every day and rejoice at it.",
        "info_2": "The foundation was registered on April 12, 2018. The founders are Nyta Federmesser and Lida Moniava. The Foundation helps seriously ill children\n                    and young adults under 30 years of age by supporting the Children's Hospice of Moscow, Children's Hospice of the Moscow Region and Hospice for young adults.\n                    We are convinced that children with severe diseases have the same rights as healthy children and should not spend their entire life in intensive care\n. The Lighthouse Charity Foundation helps to collect seriously ill children\n                    from hospitals by organizing the necessary assistance at home. \n                    Our goal is to make sure that, despite the child's illness, families can live the happiest, most loving and best life with their children and that at the end of their lives no child suffers from pain and is alone.\n                    Over a thousand and a hundred families, when faced with a severe illness or loss of a child, receive assistance in the Lighthouse Charity Foundation programs every year. Our team consists of more than 400 specialists and 500 volunteers. The fund's budget for 2022 is 950 million rubles. 15% of the expenses are borne by the state, and 85% consists of small donations from ordinary people. Families receive assistance absolutely free of charge.",
